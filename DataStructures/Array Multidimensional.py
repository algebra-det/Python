    As , when we define array
                a = array('i',[])
    here we get 1 Row and Multiple Columns
                a = array('i',[1,,56,54,4]
            It is called Single Dimensional Array

    To have Multiple Rows too with Multiple columns we have Multidimensional Arrays
                a = array('i',[],[])
    Mulitdimensional Array are not available by default
    It is available in "numpy" Module
    However this numpy module is'nt available for importing by default
    We have to Use 'PIP' in cmd to install 'numpy' or any foreign modules

    SYNTAX:
            > pip3
            > pip3 install numpy

    However to make numpy work in PyCharm we have to install it here aswell
    by going to settings > Project:(project name) >
